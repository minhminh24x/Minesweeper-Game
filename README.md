# Minesweeper-Game
This is a small project of our group with a team size of 4 people.
In the minesweeper game, each cell is a vertex in the graph. Each cell is connected to 8 cells around it (top, bottom, left, right, 4 corners). The BFS or DFS algorithm is used to iterate through all the cells surrounding the opened cell. If the cell being traversed does not contain a mine, the algorithm opens that cell. The algorithm is repeated until we spread around and encounter cells with mines.
